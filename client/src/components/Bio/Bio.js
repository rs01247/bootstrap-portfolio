                            Software developer with a B.S. in Information Systems from UC Riverside. Received training
                            from the UC Irvine web development course to broaden my knowledge and establish a path into
                            the technology sector. The last 5 years of a career in B2B sales and logistics have allowed
                            me to cultivate a skill set based in strong communication, time management, and effective
                            team work. I strongly believe that my ability to correlate a clientâ€™s perspective with
                            tangible needs directly translates into practical skills required developing projects and 
                            applications.
